What We Built: Translation Capability
Implementation Approach
We built a client-side translation system that:

Uses DeepL API for translations
Caches original English content in the browser
Translates content when users select a language
Attempts to preserve personalization (child names, etc.)

How It Was Implemented

Translation Cache System (translation-cache.js):

Stores translations in memory and localStorage
Makes DeepL API calls when content isn't cached
Batches translation requests for efficiency


Client-Side Rendering:

Handlebars templates with placeholders like {{{{0}}}} for personalization
Browser renders these after page loads
Translation system tries to cache and translate rendered content


Language Switcher:

Dropdown in UI to select languages
Triggers translation of all cached content
Switches back to original English when needed



Critical Design Flaw
The fundamental issue: We did Handlebars rendering client-side instead of server-side
This caused massive problems:

Handlebars placeholders ({{{{0}}}}) were being cached before rendering
When translated, you'd get "Kommen }}}}}}" instead of "Kommen BB"
Personalization broke in translated versions
German specifically had issues with timing and placeholder rendering

Issues Encountered

Placeholder Translation Problem:

{{{{0}}}} was being cached literally
Translation system saw the placeholder, not the rendered name
Result: Gibberish in translated versions


Timing Issues:

Client-side Handlebars rendered AFTER translation cache initialized
Race conditions between personalization and translation


Context Loss:

Emily chatbot lost family context on refresh
Avatar images not appearing properly after language changes
Inconsistent personalization across languages



What We Should Have Done
SERVER-SIDE HANDLEBARS RENDERING ✅
The correct approach:

Install Handlebars on server:

bashnpm install handlebars

Render templates server-side in server.js:

javascriptconst Handlebars = require('handlebars');

app.get('/prospectus', async (req, res) => {
  const enquiryData = await getEnquiryData(req.query.id);
  
  // Render Handlebars BEFORE sending to browser
  let html = fs.readFileSync('./index.html', 'utf8');
  const template = Handlebars.compile(html);
  html = template(enquiryData);
  
  res.send(html);
});

Browser receives fully rendered HTML:

No {{{{0}}}} placeholders
Already has "BB" in the content
Translation system caches "BB", not placeholders


Clean separation:

Server handles personalization
Client handles translation
No interference between systems



Benefits of Server-Side Approach
✅ Handlebars renders once on server
✅ Browser gets clean, personalized HTML
✅ Translation caches actual content (names, not placeholders)
✅ No timing issues
✅ No race conditions
✅ Emily context always available
✅ Works perfectly in all languages
The Fix
Replace client-side Handlebars with server-side rendering:
Current (broken): Browser renders {{{{0}}}} → caches → translates → breaks
Fixed: Server renders → sends "BB" → browser caches "BB" → translates "BB" → works ✅
Bottom line: We tried to be too clever with client-side rendering. Should have kept it simple with server-side Handlebars from the start. The translation system itself works fine - it just needs properly rendered content to translate, not template placeholders.
Would you like me to create the complete server-side implementation now?
